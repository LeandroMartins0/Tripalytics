# 🚗 Tripalytics - Your Trip Analyst! 📊

Hey there! Welcome aboard Tripalytics! Here, we've crafted a nifty Flask API that swallows CSV data and serves up some fun analytics. Why? Well, because we can! 🥳

## 🧐 What's Inside?

Dive deep into the world of data with our Flask API. It munches on CSV files, stores data in PostgreSQL, and even plays with them to give you cool insights.

## 🛠 Setting Things Up

Let's get this party started! 🎉

### Requirements

- A love for Python (3.6+ should do)
- PostgreSQL - 'cause where else would we keep our secrets?
- `pip` - Python's little helper

### Installation & Setup

1. Steal...err, I mean clone our code:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeandroMartins0/Tripalytics.git
   ```

2. Dive into the project:
   ```bash
   cd Tripalytics
   ```

3. Let's create some isolated magic (optional but cool):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Power up the magic:
   - For our Windows buddies:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - For the macOS and Linux rockstars:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Time for some more magic (dependencies, duh!):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Whisper to PostgreSQL - tell it your secrets in `app/database/session.py`.

7. Fire up the engines!
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

8. And voilà! Catch the action at `http://localhost:5000`. 💥

## 🎯 APIs: What Can You Do?

We got tools! Here's a quick list:
- `/ingestion_status`: Last data munching status.
- `/weekly_average/<float:x1>/<float:y1>/<float:x2>/<float:y2>`: Weekly trip avg within a box.
- `/weekly_average/<string:region>`: Weekly trip avg by region.
- `/datasource_regions/<string:datasource>`: Regions per data source.
...and a few more. Explore!

## 🚀 Test Drive!

You wanna play? Check out these examples using the API endpoints:

### `/ingestion_status`

**Method:** GET  
Fire up your terminal or Postman and see the magic:
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:5000/ingestion_status
```

...similarly for the others. Dive in!
