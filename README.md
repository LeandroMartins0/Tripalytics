## Introduction

This project demonstrates a Flask-based API that handles data ingestion from a CSV file into a PostgreSQL database. It also provides various endpoints for querying and aggregating data. The project is designed to showcase your technical skills, so let's dive in!

## Installation

To get started, follow these simple installation steps:

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PostgreSQL Database
- pip (Python package manager)

### Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LeandroMartins0/Tripalytics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd Tripalytics
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:

     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On macOS and Linux:

     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. Install project dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Configure your PostgreSQL database settings in `app/database/session.py`.

7. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

8. The API should now be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`. 🎉

## Getting Started

Now that the application is up and running, here are some tips to get started:

- Use tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) or [curl](https://curl.se/) to interact with the API endpoints.
- Perform data ingestion using a CSV file located in the `data` directory.
- Explore various API endpoints for data retrieval and aggregation.

## API Endpoints

- `/ingestion_status`: Provides information about the last data ingestion status.
- `/weekly_average/<float:x1>/<float:y1>/<float:x2>/<float:y2>`: Calculates the weekly average of trips within a bounding box.
- `/weekly_average/<string:region>`: Calculates the weekly average of trips for a specific region.
- `/datasource_regions/<string:datasource>`: Retrieves the regions associated with a specific data source.
- `/most_recent_datasource_for_top_regions`: Identifies the most recent data source for the top regions with the highest trip counts.
- `/total_records`: Retrieves the total number of records in the database.
- `/select_all_records`: Retrieves all records from the database.
